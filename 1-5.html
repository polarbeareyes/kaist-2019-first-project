                An age-old vendetta between two powerful families erupts into bloodshed.
                A group of masked Montagues risk further conflict by gatecrashing a Capulet party.
                A young lovesick Romeo Montague falls instantly in love with Juliet Capulet,
                who is due to marry her father's choice, the County Paris. With the help of Juliet's nurse,
                the women arrange for the couple to marry the next day, but Romeo's attempt to halt a
                street fight leads to the death of Juliet's own cousin, Tybalt, for which Romeo is banished.
                In a desperate attempt to be reunited with Romeo, Juliet follows the Friar's plot and fakes
                her own death. The message fails to reach Romeo, and believing Juliet dead, he takes his
                life in her tomb. Juliet wakes to find Romeo's corpse beside her and kills herself. The grieving
                family agree to end their feud.<br><br>

                On his 11th birthday, an invitation to the magical world flies
                to Harry Potter, an orphan boy who lives in captivity, being condemned
                by a mean aunt and a mean cousin. The lonely boy with a skinny frame and
                a lightning-shaped scar turned out to be a legendary hero who saved the
                magical world from the evil wizard. It was a magical world to be in Gyeongcheon
                and accept him as a true friend, inviting him to attend Hogwarts, Britain's best
                school of magic, and waiting for Harry. Entering a fantasy and real world, such as
                a frenetic Quidditch game played on moving stairs, entrances and broomsticks,
                Harry shows genius talent and falls into a dangerous adventure to protect the "magic stone."<br><br>

                On New Year's Eve, high school juniors Troy Bolton
                (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) mee
                t at a party while both teens are at a ski lodge during
                winter break. At the party, the two are called upon to
                sing karaoke together ("Start of Something New"). They
                find that they have a connection and decide to exchange
                numbers before going their separate ways.
                On the first day back at school after Christmas break,
                Troy sees Gabriella in his classroom, and she explains that
                she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and transferred
                to East High School over the break. Troy then shows Gabriella
                around the school. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans
                (Ashley Tisdale) as well as East High's designated “Ice Princess”
                arrives and assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning.
                Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl
                and has the scholastic decathlon captain and Chem Club president,
                Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past
                academic achievements, which results in her and Gabriella becoming great friends.
                During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thought
                s are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to
                basketball ("Get'cha Head in the Game"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musica
                l auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform
                ("What I've Been Looking For"), but Troy and Gabriella are both too shy to audition
                . When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are
                unofficially "over", Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed)
                tells them that they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's
                composer, trips and drops her music all over the stage. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her,
                and they sing together as Kelsi plays the piano ("What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)").
                Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.
