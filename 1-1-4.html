        On his 11th birthday, an invitation to the magical world flies
       to Harry Potter, an orphan boy who lives in captivity, being condemned
       by a mean aunt and a mean cousin. The lonely boy with a skinny frame and
       a lightning-shaped scar turned out to be a legendary hero who saved the
       magical world from the evil wizard. It was a magical world to be in Gyeongcheon
       and accept him as a true friend, inviting him to attend Hogwarts, Britain's best
       school of magic, and waiting for Harry. Entering a fantasy and real world, such as
       a frenetic Quidditch game played on moving stairs, entrances and broomsticks,
       Harry shows genius talent and falls into a dangerous adventure to protect the "magic stone."<br><br>
