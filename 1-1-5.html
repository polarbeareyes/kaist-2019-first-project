        "Mi Young," a former legend's detective who ranks zero in the civil service room, and "Ji Hye," an incumbent and last-ditch detective who was relegated to the civil service office.
        At home, the two men, sister-in-law Olke, growled at the slightest eye contact, 
        I saw a woman who came in to file a complaint with the civil service and jumped into the driveway. 
        She learns 48 hours later that she is the victim of a digital sex crime case that has been heralded as upload.
        Gangs, cybercriminals, women's youth, all departments in the police force.
        When the case was pushed out because of complicated procedures and lack of manpower, 
        "Mi-young" and "Ji-hye" are determined to launch an unofficial investigation. 
        As the investigation progresses, "Mi-young" and "Ji-hye" are alive with a sense of justice and the more the detective's instinct wriggles. 
        We finally get a chance to face the suspects...
        An unofficial joint investigation of the Girl Crush Combs is being conducted!<br><br>
