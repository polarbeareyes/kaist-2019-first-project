        Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), an unemployed driver,
        lives with his wife Choong Sook (Jang Hye-jin) and
        two college-age children in a shabby semi-basement apartment.
        The family struggles to make ends meet by folding pizza
        boxes and leech off the wi-fi connection of their neighbors.
        One day Ki-tae's son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is having drinks with his friend
        Min (Park Seo-joon) who is currently employed as an English tutor for the
        sophomore daughter of a wealthy family. Min is leaving to study abroad
        and suggests that Ki-woo take his place since he has been studying for
        the university entrance exam unsuccessfully for the past four years,
        although he tells him that he plans to ask the daughter to be his girlfriend,
        once she enters university.
        Ki-woo is interviewed at the extremely luxurious and spacious mansion of
        the Park family. He’s received by Mrs Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), the simple-minded
        housewife of Mr Park (Lee Sun-gyun). He gets the job and as he’s leaving the
        house notices a painting by the Parks' younger son hung on the wall. Under
        the pretext that his artistic potential should be nurtured, he suggests to
        employ as an art tutor his friend named Jessica, who he says went to art
        school in the US, but in reality is his sister Ki-jeong (Park So-Dam).<br><br>
