        <li>Romeo and Juliet summery</li><br>

        An age-old vendetta between two powerful families erupts into bloodshed.
        A group of masked Montagues risk further conflict by gatecrashing a Capulet party.
        A young lovesick Romeo Montague falls instantly in love with Juliet Capulet,
        who is due to marry her father's choice, the County Paris. With the help of Juliet's nurse,
        the women arrange for the couple to marry the next day, but Romeo's attempt to halt a
        street fight leads to the death of Juliet's own cousin, Tybalt, for which Romeo is banished.
        In a desperate attempt to be reunited with Romeo, Juliet follows the Friar's plot and fakes
        her own death. The message fails to reach Romeo, and believing Juliet dead, he takes his
        life in her tomb. Juliet wakes to find Romeo's corpse beside her and kills herself. The grieving
        family agree to end their feud.<br><br>

        On New Year's Eve, high school juniors Troy Bolton
        (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) mee
        t at a party while both teens are at a ski lodge during
        winter break. At the party, the two are called upon to
        sing karaoke together ("Start of Something New"). They
        find that they have a connection and decide to exchange
        numbers before going their separate ways.
        On the first day back at school after Christmas break,
        Troy sees Gabriella in his classroom, and she explains that
        she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and transferred
        to East High School over the break. Troy then shows Gabriella
        around the school. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans
        (Ashley Tisdale) as well as East High's designated “Ice Princess”
        arrives and assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning.
        Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl
        and has the scholastic decathlon captain and Chem Club president,
        Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past
        academic achievements, which results in her and Gabriella becoming great friends.
        During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thought
        s are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to
        basketball ("Get'cha Head in the Game"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musica
        l auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform
        ("What I've Been Looking For"), but Troy and Gabriella are both too shy to audition
        . When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are
        unofficially "over", Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed)
        tells them that they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's
        composer, trips and drops her music all over the stage. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her,
        and they sing together as Kelsi plays the piano ("What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)").
        Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.

        On his 11th birthday, an invitation to the magical world flies
        to Harry Potter, an orphan boy who lives in captivity, being condemned
        by a mean aunt and a mean cousin. The lonely boy with a skinny frame and
        a lightning-shaped scar turned out to be a legendary hero who saved the
        magical world from the evil wizard. It was a magical world to be in Gyeongcheon
        and accept him as a true friend, inviting him to attend Hogwarts, Britain's best
        school of magic, and waiting for Harry. Entering a fantasy and real world, such as
        a frenetic Quidditch game played on moving stairs, entrances and broomsticks,
        Harry shows genius talent and falls into a dangerous adventure to protect the "magic stone."<br><br>

        Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), an unemployed driver,
        lives with his wife Choong Sook (Jang Hye-jin) and

        The family struggles to make ends meet by folding pizza
        boxes and leech off the wi-fi connection of their neighbors.
        One day Ki-tae's son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is having drinks with his friend
        Min (Park Seo-joon) who is currently employed as an English tutor for the
        sophomore daughter of a wealthy family. Min is leaving to study abroad
        and suggests that Ki-woo take his place since he has been studying for
        the university entrance exam unsuccessfully for the past four years,
        although he tells him that he plans to ask the daughter to be his girlfriend,
        once she enters university.
        Ki-woo is interviewed at the extremely luxurious and spacious mansion of
        the Park family. He’s received by Mrs Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), the simple-minded
        housewife of Mr Park (Lee Sun-gyun). He gets the job and as he’s leaving the
        house notices a painting by the Parks' younger son hung on the wall. Under
        the pretext that his artistic potential should be nurtured, he suggests to
        employ as an art tutor his friend named Jessica, who he says went to art
        school in the US, but in reality is his sister Ki-jeong (Park So-Dam).<br><br>
