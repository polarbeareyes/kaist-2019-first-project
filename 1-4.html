                "Mi Young," a former legend's detective who ranks zero in the civil service room, and "Ji Hye," an
                incumbent and last-ditch detective who was relegated to the civil service office.
                At home, the two men, sister-in-law Olke, growled at the slightest eye contact,
                I saw a woman who came in to file a complaint with the civil service and jumped into the driveway.
                She learns 48 hours later that she is the victim of a digital sex crime case that has been heralded as
                upload.
                Gangs, cybercriminals, women's youth, all departments in the police force.
                When the case was pushed out because of complicated procedures and lack of manpower,
                "Mi-young" and "Ji-hye" are determined to launch an unofficial investigation.
                As the investigation progresses, "Mi-young" and "Ji-hye" are alive with a sense of justice and the more
                the detective's instinct wriggles.
                We finally get a chance to face the suspects...
                An unofficial joint investigation of the Girl Crush Combs is being conducted!<br><br>

                Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), an unemployed driver,
                lives with his wife Choong Sook (Jang Hye-jin) and
                two college-age children in a shabby semi-basement apartment.
                The family struggles to make ends meet by folding pizza
                boxes and leech off the wi-fi connection of their neighbors.
                One day Ki-tae's son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is having drinks with his friend
                Min (Park Seo-joon) who is currently employed as an English tutor for the
                sophomore daughter of a wealthy family. Min is leaving to study abroad
                and suggests that Ki-woo take his place since he has been studying for
                the university entrance exam unsuccessfully for the past four years,
                although he tells him that he plans to ask the daughter to be his girlfriend,
                once she enters university.
                Ki-woo is interviewed at the extremely luxurious and spacious mansion of
                the Park family. He’s received by Mrs Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), the simple-minded
                housewife of Mr Park (Lee Sun-gyun). He gets the job and as he’s leaving the
                house notices a painting by the Parks' younger son hung on the wall. Under
                the pretext that his artistic potential should be nurtured, he suggests to
                employ as an art tutor his friend named Jessica, who he says went to art
                school in the US, but in reality is his sister Ki-jeong (Park So-Dam).<br><br>
