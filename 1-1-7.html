        On New Year's Eve, high school juniors Troy Bolton
        (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) mee
        t at a party while both teens are at a ski lodge during
        winter break. At the party, the two are called upon to
        sing karaoke together ("Start of Something New"). They
        find that they have a connection and decide to exchange
        numbers before going their separate ways.
        On the first day back at school after Christmas break,
        Troy sees Gabriella in his classroom, and she explains that
        she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and transferred
        to East High School over the break. Troy then shows Gabriella
        around the school. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans
        (Ashley Tisdale) as well as East High's designated “Ice Princess”
        arrives and assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning.
        Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl
        and has the scholastic decathlon captain and Chem Club president,
        Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past
        academic achievements, which results in her and Gabriella becoming great friends.
        During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thought
        s are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing in addition to
        basketball ("Get'cha Head in the Game"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musica
        l auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform
        ("What I've Been Looking For"), but Troy and Gabriella are both too shy to audition
        . When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward once the auditions are
        unofficially "over", Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed)
        tells them that they are too late and leaves. Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's
        composer, trips and drops her music all over the stage. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her,
        and they sing together as Kelsi plays the piano ("What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)").
        Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.
